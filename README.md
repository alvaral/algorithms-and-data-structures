# Algorithms Questions Repository for Software Engineering

This project aims to compile a collection of technical interview questions for software engineering candidates. Each problem is accompanied by a solution in Java, JavaScript, or C++. This repository is designed to help you prepare effectively for technical interviews.

## How to Prepare

### Understanding the Process

Many candidates make the mistake of simply reading through problems and their solutions, akin to trying to learn calculus by merely glancing at problems and answers. True preparation involves actively practicing problem-solving.

### Key Topics to Focus On

To excel in technical interviews, familiarize yourself with the following data structures, algorithms, and concepts:

- **Data Structures**
  - Linked Lists
  - Trees, Tries, & Graphs
  - Stacks & Queues
  - Heaps
  - Hash Tables
  - Vectors / ArrayLists

- **Algorithms**
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Binary Search
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Recursion
  - Bit Manipulation

- **Complexity**
  - Big O Time & Space
  - Memory Management (Stack vs. Heap)

### Essential Preparation Steps

1. **Solve Problems Independently**: Attempt to solve each problem on your own first. Hints are available, but strive to create a solution with minimal assistance. Many questions are intentionally challenging—embrace the difficulty!

2. **Practice on Paper**: Write your code on paper. This exercise helps you become accustomed to the slower pace of coding without syntax highlighting, code completion, or quick debugging. 

3. **Test Your Code**: Test your solutions on paper by considering various cases: general cases, base cases, and error cases. This practice simulates the interview environment where you will need to justify your code’s correctness.

4. **Transfer Code to a Computer**: Once you’ve written your code on paper, type it into a computer as-is. Expect to make mistakes and maintain a list of errors to review before your interview.

5. **Engage in Mock Interviews**: Partner with a friend to conduct mock interviews. This will help you practice articulating your thought process and improve your interview skills.

## What You Need to Know

The questions often focus on core data structures and algorithms rather than intricate algorithms like binary tree balancing. Most interviewers expect you to have a solid grasp of the basics, so ensure you are comfortable with the following core concepts:

- Data Structures 
- Fundamental Algorithms
- Space and Time Complexity

By practicing and internalizing these concepts, you'll be better prepared to tackle the challenges presented during your interviews.
