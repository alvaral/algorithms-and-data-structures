## Objective of the Plan

To cover the main topics that typically appear in Amazon technical interviews, with an emphasis on solving algorithmic and data structure problems, as well as preparing you for system design-related questions.

### Key Topics to Study:
- **Data Structures:** Linked lists, trees (including binary search trees), queues, stacks, hash maps (dictionaries), graphs, sets, heaps, etc.
- **Algorithms:** Recursion, search (binary and linear), sorting (mergesort, quicksort, heapsort), graph algorithms (DFS, BFS), dynamic programming techniques, backtracking.
- **Basic System Design Concepts:** You might be asked a basic system design question (though it's usually not too in-depth at an entry level).
- **Behavioral Questions Based on Amazon's "Leadership Principles":** Amazon places a lot of emphasis on behavioral competencies based on its leadership principles, so it's recommended to prepare for this part as well.

### **Day 1-2: Data Structures Review (Fundamentals)**
- Linked lists (singly and doubly linked)
- Stacks and Queues
- Hash Maps and Sets
- Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees

#### Activities:
- Review the theory and key concepts of these data structures.
- Solve problems on LeetCode or HackerRank related to these data structures.
  - **Recommended Problems:** "Reverse a Linked List", "Valid Parentheses" (stack), "Binary Tree Level Order Traversal" (trees), "Two Sum" (hash map).

---

### **Day 3-4: Sorting and Searching Algorithms**
- Binary Search and its applications.
- Sorting Algorithms: QuickSort, MergeSort, Heapsort, Comparison-based sorting.
- Linear Search vs Binary Search.

#### Activities:
- Implement each of these algorithms from scratch to solidify your understanding.
- Solve problems involving sorting and searching on platforms like LeetCode:
  - **Recommended Problems:** "Binary Search", "Kth Largest Element in an Array", "Find Peak Element", "Merge Intervals".

---

### **Day 5-6: Advanced Algorithms and Recursion**
- Recursion: Basic techniques and common cases (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci, tree search).
- Backtracking: Problems involving combinations and permutations.
- Basic dynamic programming: Typical cases like "0/1 Knapsack", "Longest Increasing Subsequence", "Climbing Stairs", "Coin Change".

#### Activities:
- Work on recursion and backtracking problems.
- Spend time on simpler dynamic programming problems.
  - **Recommended Problems:** "Subsets", "Permutations", "Climbing Stairs", "House Robber", "Longest Common Subsequence".

---

### **Day 7: Graph Algorithms**
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).
- Shortest Path Algorithms: Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford (familiarity only, as these are not commonly asked at an SDE I level).
- Cycle detection in graphs.

#### Activities:
- Implement BFS and DFS and apply them to graph problems.
- Work on problems like:
  - "Number of Islands", "Clone Graph", "Course Schedule" (LeetCode).

---

### **Day 8: Basic System Design**
- Though more common in interviews for senior positions, it's useful to review:
  - How to design a simple application: for example, a URL shortener or messaging system.
  - Basic concepts like scalability, consistency, and partitioning.

#### Activities:
- Review some examples of system design online (blogs or tutorials) to get a general idea.
- You can find simple examples in the "System Design Primer" (on GitHub).

---

### **Day 9: Behavioral Questions**
- Amazon has a strong focus on its leadership principles, so you're likely to be asked behavioral questions.

#### Prepare stories based on your experiences that answer questions about teamwork, conflict resolution, leadership, and decision-making under pressure.

  - **Examples of Behavioral Questions:**
    - Tell me about a time you made a tough decision.
    - How do you handle negative feedback?
    - Tell me about a time when you led a project or team.

#### Activities:
- For each question, follow the STAR methodology (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
- Review Amazon's Leadership Principles and practice with them.

---

### **Day 10: Interview Simulation and General Review**
- Simulate a complete interview by yourself or with a friend. Time your problem-solving (typically one hour for two problems).
- Refine your weak points: Spend extra time on any area where you feel less confident.
- Review the problems you've solved throughout the week to ensure you fully understand the concepts and approaches.

---

### Recommended Resources:
- **LeetCode:** Practice with problems tagged "Amazon" and filter by "easy" to "medium" difficulty.
- **Cracking the Coding Interview:** A great book with problems and explained solutions, perfect for technical preparation.
- **System Design Primer:** To review basic system design concepts.
- **Amazon Behavioral Interviews:** Look for videos or articles on how to tackle questions based on Amazonâ€™s leadership principles.
